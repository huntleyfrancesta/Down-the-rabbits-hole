            <h3><span style="color:black">A passion for learning</h3></span>
                <p>Ever since i was alittle girl i dreamt of working behind the scenes in musical performances, acting, embroidery, art and crime scene investigations, anything you could thing of i was trying to do. I had a few hits and misses but all in
                    all the thrill of learning crafts stood with me. When coding came up as an opportunity i flocked right to it as soon as the new year arised. My passion for learning had won again. I accepted the challenge in submitted my voucher and
                    was on my way to coding! </p>

                <h3><span style="color:black">But why coding?</h3></span><br>
                    <p>I have been asked this question by close friends and family, Honestly maybe it was because of too many binge sessions of Silcon Valley or maybe it was for a better knowledge of the craft? All that i knew was that i was going to try
                        it and give it my all! It does definitely shake up my repetitive schedule. Coding has made me think more than ever before and nothing beats the feeling of finally getting your code to pass in the terminal! I always liked thinking
                        of myself as a jack of all trades and i do take pride inthe things i chose to pursue. I love to get stuck in figure a way out things, it one of those things that makes learning different crafts fun. </p>
