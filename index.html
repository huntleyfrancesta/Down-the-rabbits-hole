            <h3>A passion for learning</h3>
            <p>Ever since i was alittle girl i dreamt of working behind the scenes in musical performances,acting,embroidery, art and crime scene investigations, anything you could thing of i was trying to do. I had a few hits and misses but all in all the
                thrill of learning crafts stood with me. </p>

            <h3>But why coding?</h3>
            <p>I have been asked this question by close friends and family,Honestly maybe it was because of too many binge sessions of Silcon Valley or maybe it was for a better knowledge of the craft? all that i knew was that i was going to try it and give
                it my all! It does definitely shake up my repetitive schedule. Coding has made me think more than ever before and nothing beats the feeling of finally getting your code to pass in the terminal!</p>
